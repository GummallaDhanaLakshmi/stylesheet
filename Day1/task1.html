            The film also features numerous impressive <br>cameos.

Second half: Oh my, oh my! The <br>movie saves its best for last, especially<br> when delving into our history, <br>particularly 
the Mahabharata references.

            The story is rich with compelling elements <br>and features a cast of intriguing characters.<br>

The treatment of the narrative is wonderfully <br>natural and realistic, making it easy to immerse<br> oneself in the unfolding drama.

            The story isn't groundbreaking, but it <br>does the trick and the same goes for the<br> action which isn't bad either. The<br> greatness of this
             film lies in <br>its humor and its uniqueness.

            First half was very good, every characters<br> had a role and everyone acted well. <br>
            AR Rahman's songs and BGM was <br>
            Second half could've been better but Dhanush<br> still managed to give a decent entertainer.
